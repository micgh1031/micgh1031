### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience in the technology industry.
With a passion for problem-solving and a love for writing clean and efficient code, I have had the pleasure of working on various complex projects throughout my career.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing the scalability of a large e-commerce platform, optimizing database queries, and implementing microservices architecture for improved performance.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning and data science to expand my skill set and explore new avenues for technology-driven solutions.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development and contribute to the developer community.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with refining my understanding of cloud-native technologies, particularly Kubernetes and Docker, as I aim to incorporate them into our infrastructure.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software design patterns, performance optimization, or best practices in web development.
